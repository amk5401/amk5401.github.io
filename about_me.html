                                As a second year Software Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology one might think that computers have been a huge part of my life forever. My family however, did not receive a hand-me-down computer until I reached eighth grade. Just because this was true does not mean that I have not always had a passion for all things technical. I constantly played with circuits and toy robots when I was younger in order to satisfy this interest that I had. After school at the public library I enjoyed discovering new shortcuts and programs to make using the computer faster and easier. Since there was still so much more to learn about how computers worked I took computer programming courses in both my freshman and senior year of High School in attempt to satisfy my curiosity. This only opened up more questions about the hardware of computers, as well as the software that makes them run.

                                During my college search I looked for the major that best fit me. Initially I looked for hardware related majors but quickly noticed that the courses associated with these degrees did not capture what I was looking for. I moved on to more frontend related programs as these classes dealt with the interaction between user and hardware. I knew that this was the best choice for me, so from there, to Software Engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) was a short journey.

                                Here at RIT I learn the theory behind the code we write. I take classes with the hardware we will be writing for, such as the Raspberry Pi. In teams we step through the development process from requirements gathering through the design process to implementation and refactoring. In my later years I can focus more on specific interests such as frontend, backend, mobile, or even artificial intelligence. The greatest part for me however, is that I will get a chance to have experience in all of these topics all while bettering myself as a Software Engineer. I know that all of this knowledge that I gained, and will continue to gain, will answer more questions than I ever thought I would have as an eighth grader.

                                If I had to summarize my lifetime experience of skiing and my few seasons as a ski instructor, I would tell this single story. This story took place during a five hour lesson with a group of about six, seven year-olds who were skiing at an intermediate level. They could easily ski green circle trails and some blue square trails, but black diamond trails were what we were working towards. It was the last run before lunch and we had plenty of time to ski a blue square trail as well as take some time for a lesson while going down. We started skiing and were about halfway down the trail when one of the girls stopped. She had skied harder trails earlier that day, but for whatever reason this trail scared her. She started to cry so I skied up to where she was in the line.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p class="paragraph_about_me">
                                I tried to raise her confidence by reminding her that she had skied harder trails without a problem. She stopped crying but said she was not going to continue. I then asked her if she would like to ski it much slower with me right at her side, to which she replied no. I told her she could hold my hands, and that I would ski down the rest of the trail backwards while holding her hands. This trail worried her though, and she would not budge. I told one of the older kids, who was at a slightly higher skiing level, to lead the other kids to the orange sign where the slope was flatter and play I Spy. I then took off my skis and told the girl that we were lucky because we were going to sled down this hill. I helped her take off her skis, and with one hand I held our skis, and with the other, I held her hand. We then pushed off, and began sliding down the hill on our bottoms. We made a game trying to turn ourselves and aim for the orange sign where the other kids were waiting. By the time the girl and I got to the others, both of our faces had huge smiles. No matter the number of times I had skied since I was in third grade this was a whole new perspective as I had never slid down a blue square on my bottom.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p class="paragraph_about_me">
                                I learned thousands of things during my time as a ski instructor. I learned that fairness with the kids earns respect and trust with the children so they treat me as an instructor and not as someone to disregard. While the kids rightfully have fears of their own, I have learned that a strong confident voice will get them to listen. However most importantly I learned that to understand a situation completely I need to stop and look at the circumstance from other points of view. Just because one individual says that the best way of getting down the mountain would be on two feet does not mean that it is the only way. For some, a better way would be on your bottom.
