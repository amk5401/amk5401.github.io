                                If I had to summarize my lifetime experience of skiing and my few seasons as a ski instructor, I would tell this single story. This story took place during a five hour lesson with a group of about six, seven year-olds who were skiing at an intermediate level. They could easily ski green circle trails and some blue square trails, but black diamond trails were what we were working towards. It was the last run before lunch and we had plenty of time to ski a blue square trail as well as take some time for a lesson while going down. We started skiing and were about halfway down the trail when one of the girls stopped. She had skied harder trails earlier that day, but for whatever reason this trail scared her. She started to cry so I skied up to where she was in the line.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p class="paragraph_about_me">
                                I tried to raise her confidence by reminding her that she had skied harder trails without a problem. She stopped crying but said she was not going to continue. I then asked her if she would like to ski it much slower with me right at her side, to which she replied no. I told her she could hold my hands, and that I would ski down the rest of the trail backwards while holding her hands. This trail worried her though, and she wouldn’t budge. I told one of the older kids, who was at a slightly higher skiing level, to lead the other kids to the orange sign where the slope was flatter and play I Spy. I then took off my skis and told the girl that we were lucky because we were going to sled down this hill. I helped her take off her skis, and with one hand I held our skis, and with the other, I held her hand. We then pushed off, and began sliding down the hill on our bottoms. We made a game trying to turn ourselves and aim for the orange sign where the other kids were waiting. By the time the girl and I got to the others, both of our faces had huge smiles. No matter the number of times I had skied since I was in third grade this was a whole new perspective as I had never slid down a blue square on my bottom.
                            </p>
                            <br />

                                I learned thousands of things during my time as a ski instructor. I learned that fairness with the kids earns respect and trust with the children so they treat me as an instructor and not as someone to disregard. While the kids rightfully have fears of their own, I've learned that a strong confident voice will get them to listen. However most importantly I learned that to understand a situation completely I need to stop and look at the circumstance from other points of view. Just because one individual says that the best way of getting down the mountain would be on two feet does not mean that it is the only way. For some, a better way would be on your bottom.
